## 2024-05-22 - [Buffer Length Mismatch in HMAC Verification]
**Vulnerability:** `crypto.timingSafeEqual` throws an exception when comparing buffers of different lengths, causing a potential 500 error instead of a graceful 401 failure.
**Learning:** Even standard security functions like `timingSafeEqual` have preconditions (equal length buffers) that must be validated to prevent runtime errors.
**Prevention:** Always check buffer lengths are equal before calling `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.
